## Q4

1. Write a ZoKrates program that takes as input the public address and the current balance of the account you want to verify, and outputs a proof that the balance is greater than 1 ETH.
2. Compile the ZoKrates program to generate a smart contract, which can be deployed to the Ethereum network.
3. On Ethereum, submit a transaction that includes the address of the account you want to verify and the generated proof. The deployed smart contract will then verify the proof and return a boolean value indicating whether the balance is greater than 1 ETH or not.
